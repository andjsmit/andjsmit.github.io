To create this [Github pages site](https://pages.github.com/), I followed an excellent guide 
created by Jonathan McGlone from University of Michigan Libraries. Ironically, I had no idea 
Jonathan was a fellow Library Techie at the time. Checkout his CV.

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to translate plain text or markup to static webpages 
and blog posts.

My [robotics club](https://scecina-robotics.github.io) also used this guide to get a club website started
last week.

To help in using markdown to create blog posts, I printed off a copy the GitHub Flavored Markdown 
[cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
